<h1><center>About Me</center></h1>

<p>Hi!, My name is Juliet, and  I’m 12 years old. I live in the beautiful island of Puerto Rico. I feel very excited to share a little bit about myself with you.</p> 

<p>I’m homeschooled, which means I get to learn from the comfort of my own home, at my own pace and I have the liberty to explore subjects that I’m super interested in.</p>

<P>I’m involved in a lot of activities that I’m passionate about. I’ve been taking piano class for 3 years and it’s one of my favorite ways to feel relax, I really enjoy it. I like to performing in different recitals and playing in ceremonies for my Girl Scouts friends. I also started to learn  the violin, and I feel very blessed to have this opportunity. I’m taking swimming class , that time on the water is fantastic.</P>

<P>I’m passionate about baking, and I love making cookies. I started to learn about baking 3 years ago. I take different summer baking camp to learn more about desserts. I started my own small business call Juliet’s Bakery. The purpose of my small business is to make  desserts peanuts and tree nuts free, in that way people like my sister Giana can enjoy it. My goal in the near future is to make desserts free of the 9 principal allergens.</P>

<p>I’ve been a member of the Blessed Generation Homeschool Group and Blessed Generation Coop for almost 2 years, I participate in different group classes like art, entrepreneurship, values and more. We have a lot field trips and activities each semester. I have made a lot of friends there.</p> 

<P>I’m a proud member of Girl Scout troop 629. I have been a member for almost 8 years, and I absolutely love the opportunities it gives me to learn new skills and help my community. This year I’m going to start my journey for the Silver Award Project “Friends Allergies Talk”, I am focused on raising awareness and providing support for people with food allergies.</P>

<p>When I’m not busy with my activities, I enjoy to spend time with my family and friends. I’m also a huge fan of k-dramas, anime and anime games.</p>

<P>I’d love to keep you updated on my projects and share more about food allergy awareness! Follow me on social media for updates, tips, and more</P>
