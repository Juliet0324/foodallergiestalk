<p>I started Juliet’s Bakery because i understand that finding delicious, safe baked goods can be challenging, especially for those with peanut and tree nut allergies. I hope in the near future i can have a bakery free of the 9 principal allergens.
</p> 

<p>In a community where most bakers include peanuts and tree nuts in their recipes, we saw a pressing need for a dedicated nut-free bakery. Our mission is to fill that gap and offer a safe haven for those who must avoid these common allergens.</p>

<P>I’m involved in a lot of activities that I’m passionate about. I’ve been taking piano class for 3 years and it’s one of my favorite ways to feel relax, I really enjoy it. I like to performing in different recitals and playing in ceremonies for my Girl Scouts friends. I also started to learn  the violin, and I feel very blessed to have this opportunity. I’m taking swimming class , that time on the water is fantastic.</P>

<P>I’m passionate about baking, and I love making cookies. I started to learn about baking 3 years ago. I take different summer baking camp to learn more about desserts. I started my own small business call Juliet’s Bakery. The purpose of my small business is to make  desserts peanuts and tree nuts free, in that way people like my sister Giana can enjoy it. My goal in the near future is to make desserts free of the 9 principal allergens.</P>

<p>Every item we bake is crafted in a completely nut-free environment. We’ve designed our kitchen and processes to ensure that peanuts and tree nuts are never part of the equation, from ingredient sourcing to baking and packaging.
